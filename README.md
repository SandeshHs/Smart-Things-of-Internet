# Smart-Things-of-Internet
Smart Things of Internet (SToI) is a home automation system designed using open source hardware and software.

Project demo : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JtICKsU7DZGf8zERn9WA0VeWOv961C12

SToI provides home automation essentials like<br/>
<br/>
<b>Security</b>- doorbell, IP camera control, and notifications<br/>
<b>Safety</b>- fire, gas detection and emergency notification<br/>
<b>Energy</b> saving- Ambient light switch with remote access<br/>
<b>Comfort</b> - temperature dependent socket for air conditioners. IoT devices seamlessly to a central hub.<br/>

IOT devices are wireless and 'Plug and play' which fit into the existing wall power sockets.

Home Automation system has a dedicated user friendly Android application for notifying, monitoring, and controlling any of the devices over the same Wi-Fi network or access remotely over the internet.

Used open source hardware and software like Arduino, raspberry pi & Linux which reduced the cost of home automation by over 50% compared to commercial products that are available in the market.

The arduino codes in the file were implemented on Arduino pro-mini except the file name "hub" which was implemented on Arduino Uno R3.

Hardware used in this project include, but not limited to<br/>
Arduino Uno R3, Ardunio pro-mini, nRF24L01 2.4Ghz, Capacitive touch sensor, tempereature and humidity sensor, relays, LEDs etc.

Software used in this project include, but not limited to<br/>
Arduino IDE, Domotics and Linux OS
